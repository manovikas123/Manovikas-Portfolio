<h2>B.Tech</h2>
<p><h3>Image Forgery Detection using Deep Learning </h3>
 Developed a solution to detect forged images using ManTraNet, a pretrained deep learning model. The system 
processes images as input and leverages convolutional neural networks (CNN) to determine if an image has been 
tampered with. Additionally, it identifies and highlights the specific regions of forgery, enhancing accuracy and 
reliability. This project streamlines efforts by providing a centralized and efficient tool for identifying image 
forgeries, saving users significant time and effort.

<h3> Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction- Machine Learning </h3>
 Developed a machine learning model for predicting the presence of chronic kidney disease in individuals. The 
model utilized the Random Forest algorithm to deliver highly accurate predictions, surpassing the performance 
of existing methods. Additionally, techniques were implemented to prevent overfitting, ensuring the reliability 
and robustness of the model.
